    "* Temporal Code: spike timing in relation to a stimulus\n",
    "* Rate Code: the frequency of action potentials, which can be measured as spikes/second\n",
    "* Latency Code: shows a delay between the onset of a stimulus and the first action potential\n",
    "* Synchronous Code: shows the spikes that occur simultaneously between different neurons\n",
    "* Tuning Curve: demonstrating how 1 neuron fires preferentially to a certain stimulus feature (like the orientation of a bar)\n",
    "* Population Code: when multiple nodes (where data enters or exists) can encode information to each quality, producing more efficient perception (similar to combinatorial code)\n",

    "Synchronous, latency and temporal codes all show some relationship to time. | Synchronous codes show the concurrent timing of activity, while latency codes show the activational delay in time itself. Temporal codes show the timing of spikes.\n",
    "Temporal code and tuning curves **can** show activity toward a particular stimulus. | Tuning curves **specifically** demontrate the preferential activity of one neuron while temporal code can show the timing of activity to **any** stimulus from multiple neurons (and temporal code can circumstantially reveal that one stimulus is most preferred). \n",
    "All coding, except for tuning curves, use multiple neurons for data modeling | These show the relationship of neuronal behavior and timing in different ways (see above). "
